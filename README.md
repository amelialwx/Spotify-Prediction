# Spotify Song Prediction

A Spotify tracks analysis and success prediction for my CS109a final project at Harvard University.

## Data

Data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db) obtained using Spotify API.

Each track's features are explained on [Spotify's Web API Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features).

## Methods

This project involves binary and multi-class prediction for each song's popularity. Methods used are logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and neural network.

## Results

Full report of our methods and results can be found [here](https://github.com/amelialwx/Spotify-Prediction/blob/main/Report.pdf).
